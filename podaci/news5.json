    "Star Wars: The Last Jedi introduced the mineral planet of Crait where fans became acquainted with a new unique species known as vulptex, or the crystal fox. These crystal critters are easily recognized by their white, crystalline fur. In this recipe, standing in for the luminous pelt are coarse sanding sugar crystals, which give off the same shiny, eye-catching glow. They are sprinkled atop a buttery glazed scone, ideal for serving at a proper intergalactic tea." ,
